					I went to my dad and said to him, <br />
					There's a new kid who's come to my school.<br />
					He's different from me and he isn't too cool.<br />
					No, he's nothing at all like me, like me,<br />
					No, he's nothing at all like me.<br /><br />

					He runs in a funnyish jerkyish way<br />
					And he never comes first in a race<br />
					Sometimes he forgets which way is first base,<br />
					And he's nothing at all like me, like me,<br />
					No, he's nothing at all like me.<br /><br />

					He studies all day in a separate class<br />
					And they say that it's called "Special Ed."<br />
					And sometimes I don't understand what he's said,<br />
					And he's nothing at all like me, like me,<br />
					No, he's nothing at all like me. <br /><br />

					His face looks kind of different from mine,<br />
					And his talking is sometimes so slow<br />
					And it makes me feel funny and there's one thing I know;<br />
					He is nothing at all like me, like me,<br />
					No, he's nothing at all like me! <br /><br />

					And my father said, "Son, I want you to think<br />
					When you meet some one different and new<br /><br />
						

					That he may seem a little bit strange, it's true,<br />
					But he's not very different from you, from you,<br />
					No, he's not very different from you," <br /><br />
					
					Well I guess, I admitted, I've looked at his face;<br />
					When he's left out of games, he feels bad.<br />
					And when other kids tease him, I can see he's so sad.<br />
					I guess that's not so different from me, from me,<br />
					No, that's not very different from me. <br /><br />

					And when we're in Music, he sure loves to sing,<br />
					And he sings just like me, right out loud.<br />
					When he gets his report card, I can tell he feels proud,<br />
					And that's not very different from me, from me,<br />
					No, that's not very different from me. <br /><br />

					And I know in the lunchroom he has lots of fun;<br />
					He loves hot dogs and ice cream and fries.<br />
					And he hates to eat spinach and that's not a surprise,<br />
					'Cause that's not very different from me, from me,<br /><br />
						

					No, that's not very different from me. <br /><br />

					And he's always so friendly, he always says hi,<br />
					And he waves and he calls out my name.<br />
					And he'd like to be friends and get into a game,<br />
					Which is not very different from me, from me,<br />
					No, I guess that's not different from me. <br /><br />

					And his folks really love him. I saw them at school,<br />
					I remember on Open School Night --<br />
					They were smiling and proud and they hugged him real tight,<br />
					And that's not very different from me, from me,<br />
					No, that's not very different from me. <br /><br />

					So I said to my dad, Hey, you know that new kid?<br />
					well, I've really been thinking a lot.<br />
					Some things are different . . . and some things are not . . .<br />
					But mostly he's really like me, like me,<br />
					Yes, my new friend's . . . a lot . . . like me<br /><br />
